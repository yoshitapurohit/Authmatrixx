### Features

- **Authentication**
  - User registration and secure login
  - Passwords hashed with `bcrypt`
  - JWT-based authentication with expiration
  - Login rate limiting and account lockout after repeated failures

- **Role-Based Authorization (RBAC)**
  - Roles: `Admin`, `User`
  - Protected routes and admin-only endpoints
  - Middleware for role-based authorization

- **Activity Logging**
  - Logs for login attempts, resource access, and admin actions
  - Each log includes: user ID, role, action, timestamp, IP, status

- **AI Risk Scoring Engine (Rule-Based)**
  - Risk score \(0–100\) with levels Low, Medium, High
  - Considers:
    - Multiple failed logins
    - New IP addresses
    - Unusual login time
    - Rapid API requests
    - Admin account suspicious activity
  - High risk → automatic account block + `RiskAlert` record

- **Intrusion Protection**
  - Automatic account block on high-risk events
  - Temporary lock on 3 failed login attempts
  - Admin can unblock accounts and resolve alerts

- **Admin Dashboard**
  - Manage users (roles, block/unblock)
  - View activity logs
  - View and resolve risk alerts
  - Visual overview of security posture
